          <h2>How to Plant</h2>
          <ol class="content">
            <li>Keep seeds refrigerated 2-3 weeks before sowing</li>
            <li>24 hours before planting, soak your seeds. The seeds that float are less likely to sprout, dont plant those</li>
            <li>Before planting, warm your compost+sand mixture up to room temperature</li>
            <li>Plant 2-3 seeds per pot, sharp side up</li>
            <li>Typically, this plant takes a month to germinate, during this time it's sensetive to temperature fluctuations.</li>
            <li>If your seeds dont germinate within a month, dont worry, they can take up to 6 months if stubborn enough. Assume stubborn before assuming dead</li>
            <li>When several inches tall, move plant to a bigger pot or directly into the ground in a sunny spot</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>How to take care of your plant</h2>
          <ul class="content">
            <li>This plant will grow well in most temperatures, including withstanding temperatures of -18C</li>
            <li>The plants will grow best in direct sunlight, and might die back/shrink if left in the dark for long periods of time</li>
            <li>Giving the plant nutrients from sources like compostevery now and then will help it grow, but it will gro fine without</li>
            <li>These plants are most susceptible to rust and stem smut. And snails or slugs are a danger to this one</li>
            <li>The plant will grow tall, but it can be pruned to keep down</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Other information</h2>
          <ul class="content">
            <li>Where you plant the plant once its big enough, take extra precaution. If you do not know the reason for this precaution, ask when you know what plant it is</li>
            <li>This plant can be divided, which will give you two healthy plants</li>
            <li>This plant can be left outside all year, and can be planted directly into the ground when big enough</li>
          </ul>
